## Areas for Improvement
- Add more interactive elements.

Hover Effects and Tooltips: Implement hover effects on charts and graphs to display detailed data points or explanations. This will enhance user engagement and provide more context.
Interactive Filters: Add filters or sliders to allow users to dynamically adjust parameters like date ranges or categories within the reports.
Expandable Sections: Enable sections of the dashboard to expand or collapse, providing users with the ability to view more detailed information without cluttering the interface.
Drill-Down Capabilities: Allow users to click on specific data points to drill down into more granular data, offering deeper insights.

- Improve accessibility features.
Keyboard Navigation: Ensure all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard navigation to accommodate users who cannot use a mouse.
ARIA Labels: Use ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) labels to describe icons and non-text content, making the interface more accessible to screen readers.
Alternative Text for Images: Provide descriptive alternative text for all images and charts so that screen readers can convey this information to visually impaired users.
Color Contrast: Check and adjust color contrasts to meet WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards, ensuring readability for users with visual impairments.
Text Size Options: Include options for users to increase text size without breaking the layout, improving readability for users with visual impairments.

Implementing these improvements will enhance the user experience by making the dashboard more interactive and accessible to a wider audience.
